CPELAB

cpelab is part of a project aiming to bring CPE computation to OpenVAS and nmap.
I am developing this as a testing environment to experiment with CPE's.

Ultimately this should lead to code generators able to provide translation tools
to convert nmap OS and services detection results into CPE's. Same mechanisms
could then be used to make nmap directly CPE-able.


INSTALL:

1: create a "data" directory to store the databases
  $ mkdir data

2: download the bases
  $ ./labctl update all

3: try
  $ ./labctl
  <help message>
  $ ./labctl stats all
